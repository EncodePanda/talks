## Make your programs Free. Eye-opener to the very essence of Functional Programming

For me, functional programming was never about switching paradigms just to switch. It was always about sanity. Yes, sanity. The ability to finally do real engineering (to some extent). A safe space where you can reason about your code in isolation. Where modularity actually makes sense. Because software engineering is hard - whatever paradigm or approach you are going to choose for your next project, the complexity will not magically disappear. FP allows you to tackle the complexity in a divide-and-conquer manner. I believe that we live in era of "software alchemy" [(c) Martin Thomson], and functional programming is the first real step to bring science and true engineering to our industry.

Free monad is a concept that forges that idea into practical solution. It allows you to reason about your concerns in isolation and combine them together on a higher level. Programs written with Free are very comprehensible and maintainable (once you know how Free works).
